>I'd finished my pie and was having a second cup of coffee when I saw him. The midnight freight had come in a few minutes before; and he was peering in one end of the restaurant window, the end nearest the depot, shading his eyes with his hand and blinking against the light. He saw me watching him, and his face faded back into the shadows. But I knew he was still there. I knew he was waiting. The bums always size me up for an easy mark.

在我看到他之前，我刚好吃完了派，正在喝第二杯咖啡。几分钟前，午夜运输的货物刚刚抵达，而他在离仓库最近的饭店窗口凝视着，用手遮住的眼睛在光线下闪烁。他发现我盯着他，面孔隐没在了黑暗中。但我知道，他仍在那里。我知道，他还在等我。流浪汉们总是认为我是唾手可得的目标。
