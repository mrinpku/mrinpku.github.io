###practice 1

*I'd finished my pie and was having a second cup of coffee when I saw him. The midnight freight had come in a few minutes before; and he was peering in one end of the restaurant window, the end nearest the depot, shading his eyes with his hand and blinking against the light. He saw me watching him, and his face faded back into the shadows. But I knew he was still there. I knew he was waiting. The bums always size me up for an easy mark.*

  在我看到他之前，我刚好吃完了派，正在喝第二杯咖啡。几分钟前，午夜运输的货物刚刚抵达，而他，透过离仓库最近的饭店窗口，凝视着，用手遮住的眼睛在光线下闪烁。他发现我盯着他，将面孔隐没在了黑暗中。但我知道，他仍在那里。我知道，他还在等我。流浪汉们总将我看作唾手可得的目标。
  
###practice 2
**Alex Cross is a dead man. Failure isn't an option.**    

Gary Soneji squinted through a telescopic sight he'd removed from a Browning automatic rifle. The scope was a rare beauty. He watched the oh-so-touching affair of the heart. He saw Alex Cross drop off his two brats and then chat with his pretty lady friend in front of the Sojourner Truth School.  

Think the unthinkable, he prodded himself.  

Soneji ground his front teeth as he scrunched low in the front seat of a black jeep Cherokee. He watched Damon and Janelle scamper it to the schoolyard, where they greeted their playmates with high and low fives. Years before he'd almost become famous for kidnapping two school brats right here in Washington. Those were the days, my friend! Those were the days.  

For a while he'd been the dark star of television and newspapers all over the country. Now it was going to happen again. He was sure that it was. After all, it was only fair that he be recognised as the best.  

He let the aiming post of the rifle sight gently come to rest on Christine Johnson's forehead. There, there, isn't that nice.


Alex Cross死定了，万无一失。  

Gary Soneji眯缝着眼睛，透过一个他从勃朗宁自动步枪上卸下来的望远镜看去。这望远镜真是少有的美人啊。他看着那些感动人心的情景——Alex Cross让两个顽皮的孩子下了车，在索茹尔内·特鲁斯学校前跟他的漂亮女朋友聊着天。  

想想那些不堪设想的事情吧，他刺痛着自己。  

Soneji磨着前牙，身体将黑色吉普车的前座压低得嘎吱作响。他看着Damon和Janelle蹦蹦跳跳地走向学校的操场，在那里与他们的玩伴击掌问好。几年前，他曾因为绑架两个学校的孩童而出名，就在华盛顿州这儿。那些日子啊，我的朋友！那些难忘的日子啊。  

有一段时间，他成为了全国电视报纸上的黑暗之星。现在，这就要再次发生了。他确信这一点。毕竟，只有他是最好的，这才公平。  

他将来复枪的准星轻轻地放在Christine Johnson的前额上。这，就打这里，难道这不是个好位置？

###practice 3
The fat one, the Radish Torez, he calls me Camel because I am Persian and 
because I can bear this August sun longer than the Chinese and the 
Panamanians and even the little Vietnamese, Tran. He works very quickly 
without rest, but when Torez stops the orange highway truck in front of the 
crew, Tran hurries for his paper cup of water with the rest of them. This heat is 
no good for work. All morning we have walked this highway between Sausalito 
and the Golden Gate Park. We carry our small trash harpoons and we drag our 
burlap bags and we are dressed in vests the same color as the highway truck. 
Some of the Panamanians remove their shirts and leave them hanging from 
their back pockets like oil rags, but Torez says something to them in their 
mother tongue and he makes them wear the vests over their bare backs. We are 
on a small hill. Between the tress I can see out over Sausalito to the bay where 
there are no clouds so thick I cannot see the other side where I live with my 
family in Berkeley, my wife and son. But here there is no fog, only sun on your 
head and back, and the smell of everything under the nose: the dry grass and 
dirt; the cigarette smoke of the Chinese; the hot metal and exhaust of the 
passing automobiles. I am sweating under my shirt and vest. I have fifty six 
years and no hair. I must buy a hat. 

那个胖胖的Radish Torez叫我骆驼，因为我是波斯人，更因为我对于八月烈日的忍受能力甚于中国人、巴拿马人，甚至是矮小的泰国人Tran。Tran可以麻利地工作不用休息，但当Torez将橙色的公路卡车停在工作队伍前时，他也得和其他工人一样，飞快地去取他的那杯水。这样的高温，并不适合工作。一整个上午，我们走在这条公路上，走在索萨利托到金门公园之间。我们带着小型垃圾叉，拖着编织袋，穿着与公路卡车一样颜色的背心。一些巴拿马人拖下了他们的衬衫，像挂油布一样挂在他们的后口袋上，不过Torez用他们的母语跟他们说了一些话，让他们将背心重新穿在了背上。我们走上了一个小山丘。透过树枝间的空隙，目光越过索萨利托，我能看到海湾，那儿没有厚厚的云层，不像我和妻子儿子一起住在伯克利的地方一样，云雾厚得看不到另一面。但这里，没有一丝云雾，只有阳光打在你的头上、背上，万物的气息蒸腾般地钻入你的鼻孔，枯草和泥土的气息、中国人的烟味、路过汽车排出的灼热的金属气息。在衬衫和背心下，我的汗水流淌着。我有五十六年没有头发了，我一定要买一顶帽子。**（最后一句真的没问题么..）**
