###practice 1

*I'd finished my pie and was having a second cup of coffee when I saw him. The midnight freight had come in a few minutes before; and he was peering in one end of the restaurant window, the end nearest the depot, shading his eyes with his hand and blinking against the light. He saw me watching him, and his face faded back into the shadows. But I knew he was still there. I knew he was waiting. The bums always size me up for an easy mark.*

  在我看到他之前，我刚好吃完了派，正在喝第二杯咖啡。几分钟前，午夜运输的货物刚刚抵达，而他在离仓库最近的饭店窗口凝视着，用手遮住的眼睛在光线下闪烁。他发现我盯着他，面孔隐没在了黑暗中。但我知道，他仍在那里。我知道，他还在等我。流浪汉们总是认为我是唾手可得的目标。
  
###practice 2
**Alex Cross is a dead man. Failure isn't an option.**    

Gary Soneji squinted through a telescopic sight he'd removed from a Browning automatic rifle. The scope was a rare beauty. He watched the oh-so-touching affair of the heart. He saw Alex Cross drop off his two brats and then chat with his pretty lady friend in front of the Sojourner Truth School.  

Think the unthinkable, he prodded himself.  

Soneji ground his front teeth as he scrunched low in the front seat of a black jeep Cherokee. He watched Damon and Janelle scamper it to the schoolyard, where they greeted their playmates with high and low fives. Years before he'd almost become famous for kidnapping two school brats right here in Washington. Those were the days, my friend! Those were the days.  

For a while he'd been the dark star of television and newspapers all over the country. Now it was going to happen again. He was sure that it was. After all, it was only fair that he be recognised as the best.  

He let the aiming post of the rifle sight gently come to rest on Christine Johnson's forehead. There, there, isn't that nice.


Alex Cross死定了，万无一失。  

Gary Soneji眯缝着眼睛，透过一个他从勃朗宁自动步枪上卸下来的望远镜看去。这望远镜真是少有的美人啊。他看着那些感动人心的情景。Alex Cross让两个顽皮的孩子下了车，在索茹尔内·特鲁斯学校前跟他的漂亮女朋友聊着天。  

想想那些不堪设想的事情吧，他刺痛着自己。  

Soneji磨着前牙，身体将黑色吉普车的前座压低得嘎吱作响。他看着Damon和Janelle蹦蹦跳跳地走向学校的操场，在那里与他们的玩伴击掌问好。几年前，他曾因为绑架两个学校的孩童而出名，就在华盛顿州这儿。那些日子啊，我的朋友！那些难忘的日子啊。  

有一段时间，他成为了全国电视报纸上的黑暗之星。现在，这就要再次发生了。他确信这一点。毕竟，只有他被认为是最好的才公平。  

他将来复枪的准星轻轻地放在Christine Johnson的前额上。这，就打这里，难道这不是个好位置？
